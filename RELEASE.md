# Exstatic Release Process

This document outlines the steps required to release a new version of Exstatic, ensuring that both Elixir and native Rust code are properly updated and distributed via precompiled NIFs.

## **1️⃣  Bump version in `mix.exs`**

After you've made your code changes, update the version in mix.exs (`@version "x.y.z"`)

Now follow the steps below to release the update.

## **2️⃣  Merge Changes to `main`**

- Open a **Pull Request** including:
  - Code changes (including the version bump in mix.exs)
  - A CHANGELOG.md entry for this release.

Once approved and CI passes - **merge to `main`**.

## **3️⃣  Tag & Create a GitHub Release**

1. To create a release, check out the latest `origin/main` (this should be what you just merged), tag the new version and push it:

    ```sh
    git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version X.Y.Z"
    git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ```

    <strong>Ensure the tag (`vX.Y.Z`) matches the version in `mix.exs`, otherwise, precompiled binaries might not align correctly.</strong>

2. **Go to GitHub → Releases → Create New Release**

   - Use `vX.Y.Z` as the tag.
   - Copy the corresponding section from CHANGELOG.md as the release notes.

This triggers the `release.yml` GitHub Action, which:

- ✅ Builds precompiled NIFs.
- ✅ Uploads them to GitHub Releases.
- ✅ Makes them available for `RustlerPrecompiled`.

## **4️⃣   Publish to Hex.pm**

Once the GitHub release is live, publish the package to Hex.pm:

```sh
mix hex.user auth   # Authenticate if not already logged in
mix hex.publish     # Publish the package
```

### Important Notes:
- You **must have write access** to Zappi's Hex registry to publish.
- **Ensure you are on the `main` branch**, and it matches `origin/main`, as `mix hex.publish` publishes from your **local copy**, not GitHub.

## **6️⃣  Verify Installation**

To confirm users can fetch precompiled NIFs **without needing Rust**, test in a fresh clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Intellection/exstatic.git
cd exstatic
mix deps.get
mix compile  # Should download precompiled NIFs instead of compiling Rust
```

If this works **without recompiling Rust**, the release is successful! 🎉
